  Modification of t/util.t to make it more compatible with perl 5.6 -- Some of the
  tests failed because I forgot that the special form for opening a string as
  a file handle was only recently introduced in 5.8

  Umm. I accidently included duplicate information from two projects in the last push.
  This version has an improved version of the rabin.pl that allows (requires, actually)
  you to pass it a glob pattern before the directories it will scan.  Much better
  reporting, as well.
0.38:
  Speed up the next method a little by reducing the number of times it copies its internal
  buffer.  I've also added a script ('rabin.pl') that demonstrates how to use
  Algorithm::RabinKarp with multiple files.  Patches welcome and desired.

0.37:
  Well, it looks like I messed up the Build.PL file.  Making an incremental release to attempt
  to make it possible to build using the Build.PL, and also reduce the minimum requirements to
  install this module.
